//Sequential Execution: 
// - Operations are performed one after the other. Each subsequent operation waits for the 
//   previous one to complete. This can lead to longer total execution times but ensures that
//   tasks are done in order

//Parallel Execution:
// - Multiple operations are initiated at the same time and run concurrently. This reduces the
//   total execution time but requires that the tasks do not depend on each otherâ€™s results
