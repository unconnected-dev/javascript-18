Synchronous code executes in a sequential manner where each step must 
complete before the next one starts. In other words, it goes in order and
is unable to do anything else while an action is waiting to complete.


Asynchronous code, on the other hand, allows for other operations to happen
while waiting for a previous action to complete. This means that the program
doesn't have to wait for a task (like a file read or a network request) to
finish before moving on to the next task.
