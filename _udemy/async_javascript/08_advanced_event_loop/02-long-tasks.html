			const MAX_NUMBER = 27654321;

			function generateNumbers() {
				const arrayOfNumbers = [];
				for (let i = 1; i <= MAX_NUMBER; i++) {
					arrayOfNumbers.push(i);
				}
				return arrayOfNumbers;

			function straightforwardSolution () {
				//Straightforward solution here
				//This approach locks up the page until the task is finished
				//It can block the rendering pipeline, causing a bad user experience
				let arrayOfNumbers = generateNumbers();
				const squareRoots = [];

				//Processing the entire array in a single loop
				//Since this array is large, the forEach loop runs longer than 16ms
				//This blocks the rendering pipeline and makes the UI unresponsive
				arrayOfNumbers.forEach(number => {
					const sqRoot = Math.sqrt(number);
					squareRoots.push(sqRoot);
					const numbersLeft = MAX_NUMBER - number;

					//Updating the UI, but this doesn't reflect in real-time due to the 
					//blocking nature of the loop
					element.textContent = `${numbersLeft} items left to process`;
				});

				console.log(`${squareRoots}`);
			}


			function optimizedSolution () {
				//Optimized solution here
				let arrayOfNumbers = generateNumbers();
				const squareRoots = [];

				//This function splits the processing of the main array into smaller batches
				//This allows the JavaScript engine to process other tasks (like user input or rendering)
				//between the processing of these batches, keeping the UI responsive
				function processBatch(){
					
					const BATCH_SIZE = 50000;//Size of each batch to be processed
					const batch = arrayOfNumbers.slice(0, BATCH_SIZE);
					arrayOfNumbers = arrayOfNumbers.slice(BATCH_SIZE);

					batch.forEach(number => {
						const sqRoot = Math.sqrt(number);
						squareRoots.push(sqRoot);
						const numbersLeft = MAX_NUMBER - number;
						
						//Updating the UI, now the updates will be more responsive
						element.textContent = `${numbersLeft} items left to process`;
					});

					//If there are still numbers left to process, schedule the next batch
					//setTimeout with 0 delay gives control back to the browser's event loop
					//This allows the rendering pipeline to draw updates, improving user experience
					if(arrayOfNumbers.length > 0){
						setTimeout(processBatch, 0);
					}
					else{
						console.log(`square roots: ${squareRoots}`);
					}
				}

				//Initiate the batch processing
				//This starts the optimized, non-blocking processing of numbers
				setTimeout(processBatch, 0);
			}


			//Microtask Timing:
			// - In this solution, the next batch of processing is scheduled using Promise.resolve().then(processBatch).
			//	 This schedules the processBatch function as a microtask.
			// - Microtasks (such as those created by Promise.resolve()) are executed immediately after the currently 
			//	 running task finishes, before yielding control back to the event loop
			// - Because microtasks are executed in quick succession, the browser's event loop has less opportunity to 
			//	 perform other tasks, such as rendering updates to the screen or handling user input

			//Impact on Rendering Pipeline:
			// - The continuous processing of microtasks without yielding control back to the event loop can effectively 
			//	 "starve" the browser's rendering pipeline
			// - Although the microtask-based approach breaks the work into batches, it can still lead to a situation where
			//	 the rendering pipeline is delayed, causing the UI to become unresponsive or to fail to update in a timely manner
			// - Unlike the setTimeout approach, which allows the event loop to process other tasks between batches, the 
			//	 microtask approach can create the illusion of "non-blocking" behavior while still delaying essential UI updates
			//	 because the browser prioritizes microtasks over rendering

			//Potential Problems:
			// - While this approach may seem more efficient than the straightforward solution, it can still cause issues with UI
			// 	 responsiveness
			// - If the processing of microtasks takes too long, the user might not see any updates or responses until all the 
			//	 microtasks are completed, which defeats the purpose of breaking the work into batches
			// - This can lead to the browser's inability to render updates at the usual 60 frames per second, resulting in 
			//	 noticeable lag or stuttering in UI updates
			function microtaskSolution () {
				//Microtask solution here
				let arrayOfNumbers = generateNumbers();
				const squareRoots = [];
	
				function processBatch() {

					const BATCH_SIZE = 50000;//Size of each batch to be processed
					const batch = arrayOfNumbers.slice(0, BATCH_SIZE);
					arrayOfNumbers = arrayOfNumbers.slice(BATCH_SIZE);

					batch.forEach(number => {
						const sqRoot = Math.sqrt(number);
						squareRoots.push(sqRoot);
						const numbersLeft = MAX_NUMBER - number;
						
						//Updating the UI, but updates may not appear in real-time due to microtask timing
						element.textContent = numbersLeft + ' items left to process';
					});
