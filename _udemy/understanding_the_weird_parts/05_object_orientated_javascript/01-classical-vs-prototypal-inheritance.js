// Classical vs. Prototypal Inheritance

// Inheritance:
// - Refers to one object gaining access to the properties and methods of 
//   another object.


// Classical Inheritance:
// - Commonly seen in languages like Java, C++, etc.
// - Requires creating classes and using mechanisms like inheritance chains.
// - Uses concepts like:
//     - friend
//     - protected
//     - private
//     - interface
// - Can be verbose and strict with fixed structure and rules.



// Prototypal Inheritance (JavaScript uses this):
// - More flexible and simpler compared to classical inheritance.
// - Objects inherit directly from other objects (no need for classes).
// - Key features:
//     - Flexible: Allows dynamic modifications to objects at runtime.
//     - Extensible: New properties and methods can be added easily.
//     - Easy to understand: Avoids the complexity of classical inheritance,
//       focusing on object-to-object delegation.
